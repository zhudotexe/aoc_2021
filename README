AoC 2021
========
I'm using AoC2021 as an excuse to learn Rust (and maybe some other languages). Please do *not*
use this repository as a good source for AoC solutions or Rust practices - this is my very first
time using Rust at all, and I will likely be making many mistakes.

Also, don't expect this repo to be up-to-date with AoC - this is very much a low priority project, and
I'm spending a lot of time working on D&D projects and playing Endwalker instead.
